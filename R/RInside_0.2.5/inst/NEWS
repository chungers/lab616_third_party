0.2.5   20xx-yy-zz

   o    Applied (somewhat simplified) patch by James Bates which restores
        RInside to working on Windows -- with a big Thank You! to James for
        fixing a long-standing bug we inadvertendly introduced right after
        0.2.0 almost two years ago

   o    New example embedding R inside a Wt (aka Webtoolkit, pronounced 
        'witty') application, mirroring the previous Qt application

   o    Qt example qtdensity now uses the new svg() device in base R; removed
        test for cairoDevice package as well as fallback png code

   o    Very minor fix to qmake.pro file for Qt app correcting link order

0.2.4   2011-04-24

   o    Minor code cleanups in initialization code 

   o    New example embedding R inside a Qt application, along with pro file
        for Qt's qmake providing a complete simple C++ GUI application

   o    New examples rinside_sample{10,11} based on questions on the
        r-help and r-devel mailing list

   o    Some improvements and simplifications throughout examples/standard 
        as well as examples/mpi/

   o    Added this NEWS files -- with entries below summarised from ChangeLog
        and the corresponding blog posts

0.2.3   2010-08-06

   o    New example rinside_sample9 on how to expose C++ to embedded R

   o    New example rinside_module_sample0 to show module access from RInside

   o    Simplified rinside_sample3 and rinside_sample4

   o    Some code cleanup to help Solaris builds

   o    Implicit use of new Proxy class with operator T(), see rinside_sample8

0.2.2   2010-03-22

   o    New operator[](string) lets RInside act as proxy to R's global
        environment so that we can R["x"] = 10 to assign; all the actual
 	work is done by Rcpp::Environment

   o    No longer ship doxygen-generated docs in build

   o    Use std::string for all arguments inside throw() to help Windows build

   o    Default to static linking on OS X and Windows just like Rcpp does
  
   o    parseEval() now returns SEXP and has just a string argument for more
        functional use; it and void sibbling parseEvalQ() now throw exections

   o    rinside_sample{2,4,5} updated accordingly

   o    Two new 'R inside an MPI app' examples contributed by Jianping Hua

   o    Also added two C++ variants of the C examples for RInside and MPI

   o    rinside_sample8 updated with parseEval changes   

   o    Internal MemBuf class simplified via STL std::string

   o    Autoload simplied via the new Rcpp API

   o    Added default constructor for RInside

   o    Retire assign(vector<vector<double> >) via template specialisation

   o    Include Rcpp.h; switch to Rf_ prefixed R API to avoid Redefine macros

   o    Windows version currently segfaults on startup

0.2.1	2010-01-06

   o    Startup now defaults to FALSE, no longer call Rf_KillAllDevices

   o    Some minor build and code fixes for Windows

0.2.0   2009-12-20

   o    Initial Windows support, with thanks to Richard Holbrey for both the
        initial push and a setenv() implementation

   o    Added Makefile.win for build with the MinGW toolchain to src/ and examples/

   o    Some improvements to destructor per example in Writing R Extensions

   o    New rinside_sample5 based on r-devel post

0.1.1   2009-02-19

   o    The examples/ Makefile now sets $R_HOME via 'R RHOME', and also employs
        $R_ARCH for arch-dependent headers -- with thanks for Jeff, Jan and Simon

   o 	Added THANKS file to give recognition to those who helped RInside along

   o 	Added rinside_sample4 as another example based on an r-devel question
