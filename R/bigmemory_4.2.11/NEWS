* Modified deepcopy() with C code (thanks to Zarrar for this)
* Added -fpermissive to possibly address a compilation issue
  in Linux
* Added -lm to address a linking problem with math.h
* Fixed a problem with reading all 0's in a column in
  read.big.matrix()
* We note that there may be an inconsistency with read.big.matrix()
  and write.big.matrix() that needs to be addressed.

* Modified configure to handle a Solaris problem.
* Added definition of __C99FEATURES__ to isna.hpp; hopefully
  won't break anything.

* Set proper default value op='AND' for mwhich()

* The configuration process has been streamlined to avoid
  warnings and allow for support of Sun Studio compiler
  on Linux.

* bigmemory >= 2.2.0 is accompanied by sister packages
  biganalytics and bigtabulate; mutexes (locking) are
  abstracted to package synchronicity, available now
  on R-Forge and soon to be uploaded to CRAN.  Package
  bigalgebra is on R-Forge as a beta version while we
  sort through the range of library configuration options.
